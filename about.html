			<h1>About</h1>
			<h4>Coding</h4>
			<p>
				I have varying experience in the following languages: Java, Python, C, Racket, HTML/CSS, Javascript, MIPS Assembly.
			</p>
			<h4>Personal</h4>
			<p>
				I was born and raised in <warm>New York City</warm>, specifically in two boroughs called <warm>Manhattan</warm> and <warm>Staten Island</warm>. Both places have greatly shaped and molded me into the person I am today. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My <warm>fascination</warm> with <warm>computers</warm> and <warm>programming</warm> first started in Staten Island, where I was free to use my dad's janky Windows 95 computer. Things like Pinball, AOL, and Yahoo's now defunct Geocities website builder were only few of the things that fueled my curiosity. It was not enough for me that these programs and services served their purposes and passed the time for me; I wanted to find out how they all worked and how they were created.
			</p>
			<p>
				My time in the diverse and eclectic environment of New York City also sparked my love for learning <warm>foreign languages</warm> and learning about different <warm>cultures</warm>. I find it truly remarkable that language is able to facilitate the learning of different cultures and the creation of profound interpersonal relationships.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time, I enjoy playing the guitar, playing basketball watching movies, imitating accents (which I'm not too great at), and learning about different cultures.
